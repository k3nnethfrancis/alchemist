Eliza Framework Core Functions:
1. Decisions
   - Clear decision points in workflows
   - Simple, explicit routing logic
   - Structured output parsing
   - No nested decision trees

2. Actions
   - Single-purpose action nodes
   - Clear tool execution
   - Simple state management
   - Explicit side effects

3. Responses
   - Clear message formatting
   - Template-based responses
   - Simple routing
   - No hidden effects

When implementing these components:
- Each node should have a clear, single responsibility
- Interfaces should be simple and intuitive
- State flow should be explicit and traceable
- Documentation should explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Tests should verify both functionality and workflow integrity
