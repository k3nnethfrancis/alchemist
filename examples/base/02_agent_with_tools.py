"""Example of creating an agent with tool integration.

This example demonstrates using BaseAgent for tool-driven tasks:
1. Using built-in tools (Calculator)
2. Creating custom tools (Weather)
3. Combining multiple tools in one agent
4. Handling tool execution and results

Best for:
- Tool integration
- Custom tool creation
- Multi-tool agents
- Task-specific automation
