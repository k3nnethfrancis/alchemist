# Alchemist Development Status

## Project Overview
Alchemist is an AI agent orchestration library with a focus on composable workflows and strong state management. The current focus is on the Newsletter Workflow System.

### Newsletter Workflow System [IN PROGRESS]
An automated system for generating "Improbable Automata" newsletters from Discord content.

#### Core Components
1. Graph-Based Workflow [IMPLEMENTED]
   - Directed graph of specialized nodes
   - State management and orchestration
   - Parallel processing support
   - Error recovery mechanisms

2. Content Pipeline [IN PROGRESS]
   - Collection from Discord channels [DONE]
   - Content analysis and selection [IN PROGRESS]
   - Newsletter drafting and enrichment [IN PROGRESS]
   - Review and formatting [NEEDS TESTING]

3. Technical Foundation [IMPLEMENTED]
   - Mirascope for agent patterns
   - Pydantic for data validation
   - Discord.py integration
   - OpenPipe/Claude-3-Sonnet support
   - Comprehensive logging system [DONE]

## Current Status

### Working Features
- Discord channel integration [DONE]
  - Message retrieval from multiple channels
  - Embed processing and link extraction
  - Error handling for malformed messages

- Graph System Core [DONE]
  - Node execution framework
  - Basic state management
  - Error propagation
  - Comprehensive logging

- Logging System [DONE]
  - Component-based logging configuration
  - Multiple log formats (DEFAULT, DEBUG, SIMPLE)
  - JSON structured logging support
  - File and console outputs
  - Per-component log levels
  - Tested across all major components

### In Progress
1. Newsletter Generation [70%]
   - Content collection working
   - Analysis phase needs refinement
   - Draft generation implemented
   - Output formatting needs testing

2. State Management [50%]
   - Basic state persistence
   - Needs better error recovery
   - Checkpoint system planned

## Immediate Tasks

1. Newsletter Workflow
   - [ ] Fix content stream processing error
   - [ ] Implement proper error handling in analysis phase
   - [ ] Add validation for LLM responses
   - [ ] Test and refine output formatting
   - [ ] Implement newsletter file versioning

2. Graph System
   - [x] Add comprehensive logging
   - [ ] Add parallel processing support
   - [ ] Enhance state persistence
   - [ ] Implement checkpointing
   - [ ] Add better error recovery

3. Testing
   - [x] Add logging system tests
   - [ ] Add unit tests for each node type
   - [ ] Create integration tests for full workflow
   - [ ] Add error case testing
   - [ ] Test parallel processing

## Future Enhancements
1. Memory System
   - Vector embeddings for content
   - Relational storage
   - Context-aware retrieval

2. Platform Extensions
   - Twitter integration
   - LinkedIn support
   - Custom source adapters

## Development Guidelines
1. Code Style
   - Follow PEP 8
   - Use type hints
   - Comprehensive docstrings
   - Clear error messages
   - Use centralized logging system

2. Testing
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Error case coverage
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Logging coverage tests

3. Documentation
   - Keep this file updated
   - Document all public APIs
   - Include usage examples
   - Maintain changelog
   - Document logging configuration
